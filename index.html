<p>I am a software engineer with a background in design and video who thrives in small business and excels in large companies. Regardless of the challenge in front of me, I am driven by my experience as a musician. Performing on stage gives me the audacity to try new things while a foundation in math and science provides me the tenacity to finish what I start. I received my bachelor of science degree in Physics from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, in 2009. I started my professional career as an interactive media producer in 2004. My desire is to work with a team of individuals who are as inspired as me to deliver cutting-edge experiences.</p>

Orange County, CA (Oct 2012 - current)</h4>

<p>I joined the Appstore team to work in Android-focused web development. In 2013, I was promoted to SDE2 after successfully scaling our front-end experiences from two surfaces to over 8 unique surfaces. After which, my responsibilities grew to include resource planning and working with platform teams to unify technology stacks across all of Amazon’s Digital Storefronts.</p>

<p>Additional responsibilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unifying all dialogs in Appstore by creating common dialog framework allowing teams to  stand-up new dialogs in minutes rather than days.</li>
<li>Optimizing rendering performance - time to first-paint, file sizes, asset delivery, etc.</li>
<li>Performing regular candidate phone screens and on-site interviews</li>
<li>Enforcing reusable JavaScript design patterns including web to native event passing</li>
<li>Driving design and consensus for front-end interface components of Appstore</li>
<li>Building a new, mobile-first rendering platform for Amazon</li>
<li>Driving engineering efforts in new user experiences, including Material Design influences</li>
</ul>

Montreal, QC (Sept 2010 - Oct 2012)</h4>

<p>I worked as a consultant on GVM’s international team for 2 years developing mobile web applications. I was tasked with creating web experiences that feel like native apps. At the time, there were fewer front-end frameworks designed for mobile and I elected to build my own JavaScript framework to power unique, desktop and mobile, web experiences.</p>
