  "body": "## Background & Objective\r\nI am a software engineer with a background in design and video who thrives in small business and excels in large companies. Regardless of the challenge in front of me, I am driven by my experience as a musician. Performing on stage gives me the audacity to try new things while a foundation in math and science provides me the tenacity to finish what I start. I received my bachelor of science degree in Physics from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, in 2009. I started my professional career as an interactive media producer in 2004. My desire is to work with a team of individuals who are as inspired as me to deliver cutting-edge experiences.\r\n\r\n## Selected Work Experience\r\n\r\n### Software Development Engineer II, Amazon. Orange County, CA (Oct 2012 - current)\r\n\r\nI joined the Appstore team to work in Android-focused web development. In 2013, I was promoted to SDE2 after successfully scaling our front-end experiences from two surfaces to over 8 unique surfaces. After which, my responsibilities grew to include resource planning and working with platform teams to unify technology stacks across all of Amazon’s Digital Storefronts.\r\n\r\nAdditional responsibilities include:\r\n\r\n* Unifying all dialogs in Appstore by creating common dialog framework allowing teams to  stand-up new dialogs in minutes rather than days.\r\n* Optimizing rendering performance - time to first-paint, file sizes, asset delivery, etc.\r\n* Performing regular candidate phone screens and on-site interviews\r\n* Enforcing reusable JavaScript design patterns including web to native event passing\r\n* Driving design and consensus for front-end interface components of Appstore\r\n* Building a new, mobile-first rendering platform for Amazon\r\n* Driving engineering efforts in new user experiences, including Material Design influences\r\n\r\n\r\n### Front-End Architect, Green Vision Media. Montreal, QC (Sept 2010 - Oct 2012)\r\nI worked as a consultant on GVM’s international team for 2 years developing mobile web applications. I was tasked with creating web experiences that feel like native apps. At the time, there were fewer front-end frameworks designed for mobile and I elected to build my own JavaScript framework to power unique, desktop and mobile, web experiences.\r\n\r\n### Owner, Theoretical Media, LLC. Lincoln, NE (Nov 2009 - Oct 2012) \r\nIn August of 2009, I established my own small business.

Lincoln, NE (April 2010 - Jan 2011)\r\nIn April of 2010, I joined Pen-Link, Ltd’s new software design team where I take UI mockups and turn them in to interactive prototypes to put in front of Pen-Link, Ltd’s user base. Due to the rapid nature of the prototyping phase, I create much of the interactivity utilizing the latest HTML5 and iOS technologies.\r\n\r\n### Lead Engineer in R&D, Nanonation, Inc.
